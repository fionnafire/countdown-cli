**This is a fork of the original** `treyhunner/countdown-cli`_ **with additional features.**

This project is based on a `Python Morsels`_ exercise for a command-line countdown timer.
If you're working on that exercise right now, please **don't look at the source code** for this. ðŸ˜‰

Wondering how this package works?
**Don't look at the source code just yet!**
Instead, try implementing this package with the `Python Morsels "countdown" exercise <https://www.pythonmorsels.com/exercises/fc3be8467c634f978eae0c315f5677d1/>`_!

What's New in This Fork
